This is a document to explain how to pass from the original hexRef8 for 3D
to the new hexRef4 for 2D.

REFINEMENT PART:

I have changed 4 functions:
- getAnchorCell (completely new for 2D)
- storeMidPointInfo (I have a new one, changed from the 3D version BUT it has different inputs, so they are 2 different functions)
- createInternalFace (I have a new one, fairly similar to the original but with major modifications. We could try to combine them but doesnt look straight forward.)
- setRefinement (very similar to the original one BUT with major changes)

Here, I have no idea how to combine them with the original ones effectively

UNREFINEMENT PART (NEW version based on points)

I have changed only 2 functions (consistentUnrefinement works for 2D and 3D):
-getSplitPoints: changed a couple of lines with an if to deal with boundaries
-setUnrefinement: 2 or 3 minor modifications, to account for boundaries and the dimension of some lists.

The unRefinemnt based on points requires to change only one function on dynamicRefineFvMesh, namely the update() one, where a few line must be added to select the faces on the slave patch.

The rest of the functions concerning the unrefinement part does not need to be modified to account for the 2D case
